# Medical_Report_Analysis 🧠🩻  
NLP Model for Extracting Organ Presence Status from Medical Reports

This project is part of a broader **Medical Report Analysis System** designed to verify organ presence by comparing:

- **What is written in the clinical report (NLP)**  
  vs  
- **What is detected in MRI/CT scans by the Computer Vision model**

The goal is to detect any **inconsistency** between text and imaging that may indicate human error, reporting mistakes, or critical mismatch.

## 🧠 Project Description

Given an English **medical abdominal imaging report** (MRI/CT), the NLP model predicts the **presence status** of four abdominal organs:

- `left_kidney` → `present` / `missing` / `removed`  
- `right_kidney` → `present` / `missing` / `removed`  
- `liver` → `present` / `missing` / `removed`  
- `spleen` → `present` / `missing` / `removed`
